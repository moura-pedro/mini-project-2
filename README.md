## Overview
- **Event Cards**: We used JavaScript to fetch data from the `events.rss` file and display event information as cards. Each card includes an image, title, date, location, and a toggled description.
- **Filter System**: The application allows users to filter events by title, date, description, and category.
- **Responsive Design**: We styled the layout using CSS flexbox, ensuring that it is responsive, with a maximum of 5 cards per row on large screens and 1 per row on mobile devices.
- **Pagination**: We implemented pagination to control how many events are displayed per page, with options for 25, 50, 100, or all events. Next/previous buttons help users navigate between pages.

## EC2 Hosting
The application is hosted on AWS EC2. The demo video above demonstrates the functionality and features of the Events Manager.
